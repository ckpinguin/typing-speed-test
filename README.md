A simple typing speed tester made completely on my own (Copilot deliberately set to OFF, has to mentioned these days) for the course „100 Days of Python“.

It is not finished because I constrained myself to approx. 4 hrs of work for it.

Thus it still needs some refactorings to separate UI & logic more. And of course the styling and more UX is needed too.
